## *Śaunaka said*:

1\. O you ocean of compassion, O you very wise one, tell me from the beginning the greatness of the water (flowing) from Viṣṇu’s feet, which destroys sins.

## *Sūta said*:

2-11. The water (flowing) from the feet of Viṣṇu destroys all sins and is auspicious. He who would carry (even) a drop of it, would obtain the fruit of (visiting) all the holy places. O brāhmaṇa, the water (flowing) from Viṣṇu’s feet destroys the sin of him who touches it; he does not meet with an untimely death and would obtain the fruit of a bath in Gaṅgā. O brāhmaṇa, there is no doubt that the sin in the body of the sinner who would drink the water (flowing) from the feet of Viṣṇu, would perish. That man who would devoutly carry on his head the water (flowing) from Viṣṇu’s feet along with a Tulasī-leaf in the end goes to Viṣṇu’s abode. Men obtain that fruit by touching the water (flowing) from Viṣṇu’s feet, which is obtained by giving (pieces of) gold resembling Meru. That fruit is surely obtained by offering water to Viṣṇu’s feet and touching the water (flowing) from Viṣṇu’s feet, which is obtained by (offering) thousands of crores of cows. The fruit that is obtained by touching the water (flowing) from Viṣṇu’s feet, is crores of times greater than the fruit which is obtained by performing thousands of crores of sacrifices. O brāhmaṇa, the fruit (obtained) by touching the water (flowing) from Viṣṇu’s feet is greater than the fruit got by men by giving a crore of virgins (in marriage to worthy grooms). That fruit which a man obtains by giving a crore of elephants or by giving a crore of horses is obtained by a man by touching the water (flowing) from the feet of Viṣṇu. O brāhmaṇa, a man would get a larger fruit by touching the water (flowing) from Viṣṇu’s feet, than that which he would obtain by giving (the earth) with the seven islands along with crops (growing on it).

12\. O brāhmaṇa, listen, I shall tell you in brief. (What is the use of) telling more? By touching the water (flowing) from Viṣṇu’s feet, a sinner goes to Viṣṇu’s house.

## *Śaunaka said*:

13\. O Sūta, kindly tell me which creature formerly reached Viṣṇu’s abode by touching and drinking the water flowing from Viṣṇu’s feet.

## *Sūta said*:

14-18. Formerly in Tretāyuga there was a sinful brāhmaṇa by name Sudarśana. O best brāhmaṇa, on the day of (i.e. sacred to) Viṣṇu he would always eat (food, i.e. would not observe a fast). He always censured the sacred texts and always condemned the vows. Except his own belly he did not recognise anything else. O brāhmaṇa, when once the time of his death arrived, he died. The messengers of Yama came (to his place), and binding him they took him to Yama’s abode. Seeing him, the brother of Yamunā (i.e. Yama) angrily asked his minister: “O minister, tell (me) from the root (i.e. from the beginning) what his merit is and what his sin is. This brāhmaṇa seems to be a great sinner and a man of cruel acts”.

## *Citragupta said*:

19-21. Listen to his sins(s). He has no merit even of the size of an atom (to his credit). O lord, even on the day of (i. e. sacred to) Viṣṇu, he always used to eat (food). O king, that mean man who would eat on the day of (i.e. sacred to) the lord of Kamalā (i.e. on the day sacred to viṣṇu), would eat feces and goes to a fearful hell. Give him a place in a hell for a hundred periods of Manu. Then he will be born in the stock of a śūdra.

## *Sūta said*:

22-28. O brāhmaṇa, then, by Yama’s order his terrible messengers threw him into feces (where he remained) for more than a hundred ages of Manu. Freed from there he became (i.e. was born as) a village-pig on the earth. For a long time he would remain in hell due to his having eaten food on the day of (i.e. sacred to) Viṣṇu. Then, O brāhmaṇa, the time of his death arrived, and he died. He obtained a birth (i.e., was born) in the stock of crow and always ate feces. O brāhmaṇa, one day this crow of a śabara drank the water, after the śabara’s death, (flowing) from Viṣṇu’s feet and remaining (i.e. collected) at the door (of the temple) and being killed by a hunter, fell (dead) on the same day. He, the eater of offerings, got into a divine, auspicious chariot to which royal swans were yoked, and went to Viṣṇu’s abode. (I have) told you the greatness of the water (flowing) from (Viṣṇu’s) feet. The sin of a s inful man who listens to it, perishes.
