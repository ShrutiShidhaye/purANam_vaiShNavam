## *Mahādeva said*:

1-6. I shall (now) describe another excellent holy place Durdharṣeśvara, by merely remembering which even a sinner would become meritorious. When the war between gods and demons had taken place, and when the demon had died, Uśanas (i.e. Śukra), the son of Bhārgava, had observed here a vow difficult to practise, had propitiated Mahādeva, not easily accessible and the cause of the world, and obtained the formula (called) Mṛtasañjīvanī (bringing the dead back to life) from Śiva, for the demons. It is well-known in the world. A man who has bathed at Kāyatīrtha and worshipped Maheśvara called Durdharṣeśvara, is freed from all sins. O daughter of the (Himālaya) Mountain, in this respect listen to an old account. Formerly when the battle between Vṛtra and Indra took place, the gods were vanquished by the demons. Indra, the lord of gods, thinking what to do, went to Bṛhaspati.

## *Indra said*:

7-8. You are our preceptor. You are always actually the guardian of gods. You are famous, the best of sages. O treasure of kindness, favour me. I am vanquished by Vṛtra, O you of a good vow, where shall I go?

## *Bṛhaspati said*:

9-12. O lord of gods, listen. I shall tell you (that) by which you (will) always (be) happy. If you desire your well-being, then do as I tell you. Go to Sābhramatī, and having gone there be happy. The god called Durdharṣa, causing well-being, always dwells there. O lord of gods, he gives desired objects. This is the truth and the truth only.

Having heard Bṛhaspati’s words, he went to that river. Having bathed there, the lord of gods worshipped that Maheśa. Due to the bath and worship Śrī Maheśvara was pleased.

## *Mahādeva said*:

13\. I will always give every object that you desire.

Hearing (these) words, the lord of gods said (these) great (i.e. important) words:

## *Indra said*:

14-15. You are the lord of all the worlds. You are the cause and the (highest) position. You are always perceived by me to be god Viśveśvara. O Viśveśvara, O master of gods, if you are pleased, then, O Mahādeva, kill Vṛtra. This is my great desire.

## *Mahādeva said*:

16-17. O lord of gods, at your words, this Vṛtra is (i.e. will be) killed by me. O lord of gods, take the weapon which will be given by me. Due to its contact with (his) life, you will certainly kill him.

## *Indra said*:

18\. O lord of the universe, what is that missile with which I shall kill Vṛtra? What is that which you have fashioned as superior to the thunderbolt? When have you fashioned it?

## *Mahādeva said*:

19-23. This is the Pāśupata missile which I have formerly fashioned. It was not given to anyone (else). O Indra, I have preserved it for you. O god, you have bathed here and worshipped (me) here. Therefore, take this weapon from me, with which you will kill Vṛtra.

Due to Śrī Maheśa’s favour, Indra obtained it; and with that he killed the very mighty Vṛtra. All that took place here by the grace of Durdharṣeśa. That was secured merely by a bath and worship, O goddess. It was secured due to the glory of the holy place. O beautiful lady, this is the truth and the (only) truth. Realising this, O chief goddess, a man should bathe there. Seeing Mahādeva destroys all sins.
