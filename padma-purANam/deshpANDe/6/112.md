## *Śrī Kṛṣṇa said*:

1-5. Hearing these words of him, Pṛthu, with his mind amazed, devoutly honoured Nārada and allowed him to go, O dear one. Therefore, this triad of vows—the two in Māgha and Kārtika, and the one of Ekādaśī—is very dear to me. To me Tulasī among plants is dear, Kārtika among months is dear, Ekādaśī among days is dear, and Dvārakā among the holy places is dear. He who with his senses conquered resorts to these, becomes dear to me; not like that (i.e. so dear) with sacrifices etc. He who is devoted to these, should not, due to my grace, he afraid of sins as a rule.

## *Satyabhāmā said*:

6-8. O lord what you told me, viz. that Kalahā was emancipated by the religious merit given by others, causes wonder. This month of Kārtika having such efficacy, is dear to you, since due to bath and (giving) gifts (in that month) sins like cheating one’s master have gone (i.e. go). O lord, if one gets the religious merit given by another person, then in what way does a man get the religious merit not given to him?

## *Śrī Kṛṣṇa said*:

9-29. Listen properly with which act men receive religious merit and sins not given to them. The region, the village and the families should have the portion of (the fruit of) acts etc. But in Kali-age only the doer gets the fruit of the religious merit or the sin. This arrangement is said (to obtain) even when no contact takes place. Know as to how religious merit and sins pass (to another person) through contact. Due to being paired together, going together, eating from the same pot, a man would duly get half the portion of religious merit or sin. A man always gets one-fourth portion of the religious merit or sin (of another person) through teaching, acting as a priest at a sacrifice, or eating (after sitting) in the same line. A man gets one-sixth portion of the religious merit or sin (of another) through (sitting on) the same seat, same vehicle, and due to the contact of (another man’s) breath with his body. A man always gets one-tenth portion of the religious merit and sins (of another person) through touching (him), talking (to him) or praising (that) other person. A man would obtain one-hundredth portion of the religious merit or sin of another person by seeing, listening to, or thinking in his mind about him. He who censures another person, acts wickedly towards him or disregards him, gets (the fruit of) the sin committed by him, and gives him his own religious merit. A person, except the wife, a hired servant and a disciple of the man who does meritorious acts, serving him, and not getting the money in accordance with his service would also share the religious merit of him (who is served) in lieu of his service. A waiter at meals who ignores serving a man taking food after sitting in the same line as others, would share one-sixth of his sin. He who, while bathing or performing sandhyā prayer etc., would touch or speak (with another person), would very certainly give one-sixth of his religious merit to that person. Another person who gives money to a person who asks for it for a religious purpose would get the fruit due to his (i.e. latter’s) religious merit. He who performs a religious act after snatching another’s wealth, incurs sin, and the fruit due to that (religious act) goes to the person having money (and giving it for the religious purpose). A rich man shares in proportion with his wealth the religious merit of the man who dies without repaying the money (borrowed from the rich man for the religious act). One who gives an idea, one who approves of it, one who gives the implement, one who compels, would obtain one-sixth portion of the religious merit or sin. A king would take out from his subjects one-sixth portion of their religious merit or sin. A preceptor would obtain half the portion of the religious merit from (i.e. of) his disciple; a husband (would obtain half the portion of the religious merit) of his wife, a father of his son, and a wife also (would obtain half the portion of the religious merit) of her husband. She, pleasing him, always behaves according to his mind (i.e. desire). The giver of a gift for the man who gives gifts with the hand of (i.e. through) another person, except a hired servant or his son, would extract one-sixth portion (of the religious merit of the donor). He who gives subsistence would extract one-sixth of the portion of him to whom the subsistence is given, provided he does not make him serve himself or any other (person).

30\. In this way, the religious merit and sins earned by others, always go, though not given (to others). Listen to this excellent account, which is old, and which gives great religious merit.
