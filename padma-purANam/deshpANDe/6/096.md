## *Pṛthu said*:

1-3. O brāhmaṇa, (after listening to) the vow of Kārtika that you told in detail, and the worship of Viṣṇu at the Tulasī root that you told, I desire to ask about the greatness of Tulasī. How is she so very dear to the god of gods, Viṣṇu, Śārṅgin? How and at what place has she sprung up, O Nārada? (Please) tell this in brief. I look upon you as omniscient.

## *Nārada said*:

4-11. Formerly when Rudra hurled down the Ocean’s son, the lord of demons, gods like Brahmā bowed to Rudra with their heads (bent). O king, listen. I shall tell you the greatness of Tulasī. I shall tell you all the old account with its history. Formerly, Indra surrounded by all deities and waited upon by celestial nymphs, went to Kailāsa mountain, to see Śiva. When he went to Śiva’s house, he quickly saw there a man of fearful deeds and fierce due to his fangs and eyes. He asked him: “O, who are you? Where has the lord of the world gone?” When asked repeatedly like this, he did not speak. O king, Indra got angry, reproached him, and said (these) words, “O, though asked by me you have not given a reply. Therefore, I shall kill you with the thunderbolt. O you wicked one, who is your protector here?” Speaking like this, then Indra struck him hard with his thunderbolt. Due to that (stroke) his throat became dark blue and the thunderbolt was reduced to ash. Then Rudra blazed, as it were burning with lustre. Seeing (this), Bṛahaspati quickly joined the palms of his hands. And Indra prostrating like a staff on the ground started praising (him).

## *Bṛhaspati said*:

12-14. Obeisance to Devādhideva (i.e. god of gods), to Tryambaka (i.e. having three eyes), to Kapardin (i.e. having braided and matted hair), to Tripuraghna (i.e. the destroyer of Tripura), to Śarva; salutation to the killer of Andhaka. Salutation to Virūpa (i.e. the deformed one), to Atirūpa (i.e. having a superior form), to Bahurūpa (i.e. the multi-formed one), to Śambhu, to the destroyer, and the giver of the fruit of the sacrifices. (Salutation) to the destroyer of Death, to Kāla (i.e. Death), to him, having a deadly snake; salutation to him who destroyed Brahmā’s head; repeated salutations to the brāhmaṇa.

## *Nārada said*:

15-16. Thus praised, Śiva, withdrawing the flame capable of burning the three worlds, said to the best brāhmaṇa (i.e. Bṛhaspati): “O brāhmaṇa, ask for a boon. I am pleased with this praise of (i.e. done by) you. Be famous as (i.e. by the name) ‘Jīva’ as you gave back (i.e. saved) Indra’s life.”

## *Bṛhaspati said*:

17\. If, O god, you are pleased, (then) go to Indra who has sought your refuge. May this fire, risen from the (third) eye on your forhead [forehead?] be quelled.

## *The lord said*:

18\. How can this (fire) enter the eye on the forehead? I shall cast it (far) away so that it would not trouble Indra.

## *Nārada said*:

19-24a. Saying so, and holding it in his hand, he threw it into the salt Ocean. It fell at the confluence of the river Gaṅgā and the Ocean. Then it got a child’s form and wept. Due to the sound of its weeping the earth repeatedly trembled. Heaven and Satyaloka became deafened due to that sound. Hearing it, and being very much wonderstruck, Brahmā went there (saying): ‘What is this?’ Just then he saw the child on the lap of the Ocean. Seeing Brahmā coming, the Ocean too, joined the palms of his hands, and bowing to him with his head (bent) put the boy on his lap. Then Brahmā said (these) words: “Whose wonderful child is this?” Hearing (these) words of Brahmā, the Ocean said (these) words.

## *Brahmā said*:

24b-25a. O you lord of the rivers, wherefrom did you get this very strong boy, by whose sound gods, demons and great serpents are frightened?

## *The Ocean said*:

25b-27. O Brahman, this is my boy born on the river Gaṅgā. O lord of the world, perform for him the ceremonies (performed) at the birth of a child etc.

Ocean’s son seized Brahmā’s beard, and repeatedly shook it. From the eyes of him whose beard was (thus being) shaken, tears came (out). Somehow getting his beard freed, Brahmā said to the Ocean.

## *Brahmā said*:

28-30. Since he held these tears from my eyes, therefore, he will be famous by the name ‘Jalandhara’. Now only he will be a youth, master of all weapons and sacred books and will not be killed by any being except Rudra; and he will go where a born one goes.

## *Nārada said*:

31-33. Speaking like this and calling Śukra he consecrated him on the throne. Taking leave of the lord of rivers, Brahmā vanished (from there). Then, the Ocean, with his eyes blooming with joy on seeing him, solicited Kālanemi’s daughter Vṛndā for (being) his wife. Those demons, led by Kālanemi, were glad and gave that daughter to him (i.e. to Jalandhara). He, the mighty and powerful one, aided by Śukra, getting them as best friends, ruled over the earth.
