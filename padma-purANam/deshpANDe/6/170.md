## *Mahādeva said*:

1-5. A holy place superior to this holy place is called Saṅgama. Here that Sābhramatī Gaṅgā has joined the ocean. A man should bathe and give gifts there. Having bathed here, even those who are great sinners, get salvation. One desiring the good of his kinsmen, should offer a śrāddha there. When a śrāddha is performed here, the man would certainly live in the world of the dead ancestors. At that place where god Sāgara (i.e. the divine Ocean) always joins Gaṅgā, (even) the murderer of a brāhmaṇa is freed. Then what to say of other sinners? When dull-witted men do not know about the holy place there, then a holy place in my name should be fashioned.
