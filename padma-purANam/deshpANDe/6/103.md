## *Nārada said*:

1-12. Viṣṇu having gone to Jalandhara broke through his cover and decided to break (i.e. spoil) the vow of chastity of Vṛndā. Respectable Vṛndārakā saw in her dream her husband mounted upon a buffalo, smeared with oil, naked, adorned with black flowers, and waited upon by groups of eaters of raw flesh, (saw him as) having gone to the southern direction clean-shaved and covered with darkness. (She saw) her city plunged into the ocean with herself. Then the young lady, (trying to) ascertain (the meaning of) her dream, awoke. She repeatedly saw the sun that had risen, as having holes and steady. Knowing it to be undesirable, she, overcome by fear and weeping did not find pleasure at the principal gate and upper story. Then with two (of her) friends she went to the city-garden. The young lady, even after having gone there, did not get pleasure anywhere. Going from forest to forest, she was not at all aware of herself. Then the young lady who was wandering, saw two demons very fierce, having lion-like faces, and fierce fangs and eyes. Seeing them, she being extremely alarmed, became wholly engaged in running. She saw a calm ascetic observing silence with his disciples. Then putting, through fear, her creeper-like arm round his neck she said: “O sage, protect me who have sought your shelter.” The sage, seeing her alarmed and followed by the demons, angrily turned away the fierce demons just with a *hum* sound. Vṛndā, seeing them to have gone to the sky due to his hum sound, fell (i.e. prostrated herself) on the ground like a staff and spoke (these) words:

## *Vṛndā said*:

13-14. O you treasure of compassion, you have protected me from a terrible fear. So I desire to say something respectfully. Kindly listen to it. O lord, O you of a good vow, my husband Jalandhara has gone to fight with Rudra. Tell me how he is (faring) in the battle.

## *Nārada said*:

15-18. The sage having heard the words looked about with compassion. Just then two lordly monkeys came and saluting him stood before him. Then ordered by the indication of his creeper-like brows, they went to the sky. Having gone, the monkeys returned within half a moment and stood before him. Seeing them having in their hands the head and trunk of the Ocean’s son, she, afflicted by the grief for her husband, fell unconscious on the ground. She was sprinkled over with the water from the pitcher and was brought back to consciousness by the sage. Putting her forehead on that of her husband, she, being dejected, wept.

## *Vṛndā said*:

19-20. O lord, how is it that you who formerly amused me with pleasing news, are not talking to me, your innocent beloved. How is it that you, the conqueror of the three worlds, who vanquished gods with gandharvas and Indra, were killed by an ascetic (i.e. Śiva)?

## *Nārada said*:

21a. Thus weeping, Vṛndā said (these) words to the sage.

## *Vṛndā said*:

21b-22. O you treasure of penance, O best sage, his life is very dear to me. I think you alone are capable of bringing him back to life.

Hearing her words the sage laughed and said:

## *The sage said*:

23\. It is not possible to bring back to life him who is killed by Śiva in a battle. Yet full of pity for you, I shall revive him.

## *Nārada said*:

24-26. Speaking like this, when he just vanished, just then the Ocean’s son, with his mind pleased, embraced and kissed Vṛndā. Then Vṛndā too seeing her husband, delighted in mind; she lived in the forest with him, and enjoyed with him for many days. Once, at the end of the coitus seeing him to be Viṣṇu only, Vṛndā getting angry censured him and spoke (these) words:

## *Vṛndā said*:

27-31. O Viṣṇu, fie upon the conduct of you, molesting another’s wife! I have recognized you to be actually an illusory ascetic. The two door-keepers of you whom you showed me through your Māyā (illusion), shall become demons and kidnap your wife. You too, afflicted with the grief due to your wife and assisted by the monkeys wander in the forest with him, the lord of all who has become your disciple.

Speaking like this, Vṛndā, though prohibited by Viṣṇu, not having any mental attachment for him, entered fire. Then Viṣṇu, repeatedly remembering her, and having covered himself with the ash of Vṛndā’s funeral pyre, remained there only; and though advised by the groups of sages and siddhas, did not obtain peace.
