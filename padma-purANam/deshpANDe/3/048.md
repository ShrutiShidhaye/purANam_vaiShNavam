## *Yudhiṣṭhira said*:

1\. O great sage, you have told me all this account of Prayāga. Similarly tell me everything so that it would liberate me.

## *Mārkaṇḍeya said*:

2-7. O king, listen, I shall explain: This whole world is said to be Brahmā, Viṣṇu and Īśāna, the immutable lord of the deities. Brahmā creates the creatures and whatever is immobile and mobile. The highest Viṣṇu protects them, the created beings, in the world. At the end of a kalpa Rudra destroys the entire world. He neither gives, nor does he accept, and never perishes. He who sees him (to be) the lord of all beings, (indeed) perceives. Now Brahmā is at the north of Pratiṣṭhāna. The highest lord being Maheśvara, remains at Vaṭa. The gods with gandharvas, siddhas and great sages always take care of the highest one. Those who are bent on doing sinful deeds and others (like them) who are (there), do not obtain the highest position.

## *Yudhiṣṭhira said*:

8\. You have told me properly as to what is heard about them. For what reason, do these, dear to the world, remain (here)?

## *Mārkaṇḍeya said*:

9-15. These viz. Brahmā, Viṣṇu and Maheśvara (i.e. Śiva) live at Prayāga. I shall tell you the reason. Listen to the fact, O Yudhiṣṭhira. The region of Prayāga is five yojanas extensive. They, who remove sinful deeds, live (there) for protecting (the region). Even the slightest sin (committed) in that the (region) will cause (a man) to fall into hell. Thus, Brahmā, Viṣṇu, along with Śiva (live) at Prayāga. The seven islands, oceans, mountains, supported (by them) remain on the earth, till deluge, O Yudhiṣṭhira, all the other many (objects) that are (there) (in fact everything) beginning with the earth is fashioned by these three deities. This is a holy place of Prajāpati; and is well-known as Prayāga. O Yudhiṣṭhira, this Prayāga is meritorious and auspicious. Rule your kingdom, O lord of kings. Be with your brothers.
